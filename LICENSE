A significant part of the code in this repository has been written by third-
parties, and there are a few binaries as well. The authors retain their full
copyright on these, even if not mentionned explicitely (I've done my best to
do proper attribution, but there's a significant portion of the content that
is not yet attributed correctly — help is welcome).

That being said…

All code except code written by third-parties released under the MIT License.
